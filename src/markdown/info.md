__How we work:__

We use questions as the basis for all the work we do. In the process of answering those questions, we build tools along the way. Those tools are the outcomes and products that we deliver. They range from digital products to prototypes to manufacturing systems and beyond.

We work best when solving problems that combine hardware, software and infrastructure.
