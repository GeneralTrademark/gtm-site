### __What does a future digital 3D studio look like?__

* ###### Areas of focus: **3D printing, Prototyping, Research, VR, AR**
* ###### Documentation: **[Github](http://github.com)**

Making digital 3D things is too hard. It requires in-depth knowledge of CAD/Modeling programs, experience 3D printing and an education in engineering or industrial design.

What would change if it were more direct and accessible.

Advances in VR modeling, AR tools and 3D printing make it possible to design a closed loop system to manifest a concept much more easily.

### __m01 printer__

Please visit the [mini-site](printer.generaltrademark.com) for more details.

The m01 printer is designed to address the shortcomings of open source printers available today. Its feature set is on par with existing market leaders like the Ultimaker and Prusa i3.

The goal of this printer is to remove the majority of the road blocks people encounter when 3D printing on home studio machines. It's been designed to 'just work' for the majority of users.

Its feature set is designed to allow rapid iteration of objects up to 1ft^3 at 30% of the time of traditional machines. The hypothesis is that for iteration of most objects, the resolution of most printers is too high. By speeding up the printing time, the printer itself becomes a more integrated part of the design process. Not an end point.

The goal is to combine this ability with a toolset that brings modeling tools into the studio setting at large, not just confined to the designers screen.

### __A weird 3D world && a weird 3D studio__


A work in progress to develop a working studio environment heavily inspired by [Evelyn Eastmond at eleVR](http://elevr.com/prototyping-stack-space/) and [Brett Victor](http://worrydream.com/SeeingSpaces/).
