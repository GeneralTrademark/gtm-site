[Pneuhaus](http://pneu.haus/) has developed an ingenious series of connector nodes that are derived from platonic solids. These parts enable the creation of a wide range of shapes and geometries. We are working closely with them to productize the nodes and develop a next generation manufacturing & procurement process.

### __Research__

The world around us is built up of mostly modular complex geometries micro scales. These geometries that are found in nature are the foundation for a type of thinking pioneered by Buckminster Fuller and seen today in everything from architecture to software.

This project investigates how the act of play and hands on experimentation might slightly change how people think by introducing them to concepts of modularity and complex geometry outside of traditional mathematics.

Forms created by nodes are similar to those seen in bubbles for instance.

### __Manufacturing__

This project is ongoing. The following are a few shots from the process of design for manufacturing. We are working towards a real-time dynamic order â†’ procurement process through front end software and a manufacturing back end using SLS printing.
