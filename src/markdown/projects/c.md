Environment, nutrients, and genetic makeup are all confounding variables in the morphological expression of bacteria. Visually studying the spatiotemporal value of bacteria is then important in quantifying their dynamic behaviors. Like humans, bacteria are able to communicate to one another, fight for nutrients, and form communities or biofilms and those variables can be observed in its patterning.

### __Plate illuminator__

The plate illuminator was designed to be a compact prototype to allow the researchers at Danino Lab to make time lapse videos of the bacterial growth. We developed an open source plate illuminator using simple 3D printing parts and accessible electronics.

You can find documentation and a build guide [here (coming soon)](http://github.com)

We are currently on v0.1 and developing v0.2 to enable better stable time lapses, and a more even light source.

### __Time lapse & Image analysis__

The next stage of this project is in progress. We are working with researchers in the lab to develop software to better control the time lapse results, and figure out a user friendly way of using machine learning to do image analysis of the growth.
